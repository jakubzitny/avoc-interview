"Please hire me" TODO app
========

- ``git clone git@github.com:jakubzitny/avoc-interview.git``
- ``cd avoc-interview``
- ``npm install``
- ``npm start``
- ``node server.js``
- open chrome with --disable-web-security flag, on mac just enter ``/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --disable-web-security &``
- go to ``http://localhost:8080/index.html``

## What didn't work
- originaly all POST and DELETE api reqests didn't work, now seems to be okay (morning)
- the subtask completion toggling still doesn't work on api side

##Â Implementation struggles
Lack of react experience => small problems with react and react-tools versions, browserify + reactify, jest, heroku => took a bit longer than expected :(
